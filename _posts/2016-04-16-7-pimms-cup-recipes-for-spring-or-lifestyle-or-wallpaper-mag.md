description: "If Spring had an official cocktail, the Pimm's Cup would be it. It's ultra-refreshing, bright and vibrant-and as easy to make as it is to drink. To mix a basic version of the classic British cocktail, all you need is Pimm's No. 1, ginger ale (or some sort of lemon-lime soda), cucumber and lemon."
