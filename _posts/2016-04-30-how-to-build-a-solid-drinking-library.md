description: "Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars."
