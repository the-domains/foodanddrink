            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Collection of Exciting New Booze Books</h1><p>It seems like just about everyone has a cookbook, cocktail manual or spirits' history guide out on the market. A lot of superb ones cross our path with regularity-from new to old -but some really set themselves apart.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It's ultra-refreshing, bright and vibrant-and as easy to make as it is to drink. To mix a basic version of the classic British cocktail, all you need is Pimm's No. 1, ginger ale (or some sort of lemon-lime soda), cucumber and lemon.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/81e7943555bcd38f0d3a304708ede962df3f224f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
